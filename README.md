# Med-AI: Secure, Smart, and AI-Powered Healthcare on the Blockchain

## Inspiration

Healthcare data is often fragmented, insecure, and difficult to access for patients and medical professionals alike. Inspired by the need for a decentralized, AI-driven healthcare system, we built **Med-AI**—a platform that securely stores medical records, provides AI-driven medical assistance, and integrates with fitness apps for personalized insights. Our goal was to leverage cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, AI, and natural language processing to create a more transparent and efficient healthcare ecosystem.

## What it does

Med-AI provides a comprehensive healthcare solution by:

- **Securely storing medical records** using blockchain and IPFS.
- **Answering medical queries** with MedLLaMA-2, an advanced AI model.
- **Assisting with appointment scheduling** and medication reminders via RASA AI, which is integrated with MedLLaMA-2 for more seamless interaction.
- **Ordering medicines** through the RASA AI bot.
- **Integrating with Fitbit fitness data** to monitor trends and offer health insights, including heart rate and calories burned on the dashboard.
- **Enhancing doctor-patient interactions** through a user-friendly web interface.

## How We Built It

We used a combination of technologies to bring Med-AI to life:

- **Blockchain & IPFS**: Medical records are securely stored and accessed via a decentralized system.
- **Solidity Smart Contracts**: We wrote smart contracts using Solidity to handle various healthcare data interactions and transactions. These contracts ensure secure, transparent, and efficient processes, including consent management and access control.
- **Ethereum & Ganache**: We deployed the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, using Ganache for local testing and simulation. This setup ensures that all transactions are immutable and transparent, enhancing the security and trust in the system.
- **Truffle**: We used Truffle for smart contract development and deployment. Its built-in testing framework and migration system allowed for streamlined contract testing and deployment on both local and public Ethereum networks.
- **MedLLaMA-2**: A fine-tuned AI model designed to answer medical queries based on reliable datasets.
- **RASA AI**: A conversational AI framework used for appointment scheduling, medication reminders, and medicine ordering.
- **Fitbit Fitness Integration**: Syncing Fitbit data to provide insights into heart rate, calories burned, and overall fitness.
- **addle Cloud Platform**: Integrated the Calendar API to streamline appointment scheduling and reminders.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web application allowing patients and doctors to interact seamlessly with the system.

## Challenges We Ran Into

Building Med-AI came with its fair share of challenges:

- **Ensuring Data Security**: Implementing blockchain-based storage while maintaining fast retrieval times.
- **Smart Contract Development**: Writing and testing secure Solidity contracts for data handling and transaction processes on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Using Truffle**: Leveraging Truffle’s features for smooth contract testing and deployment, particularly in local development environments like Ganache.
- **Fine-Tuning AI Models**: Training and optimizing **MedLLaMA-2** for accurate and context-aware medical responses.
- **Conversational AI Accuracy**: Designing **RASA AI** workflows that understand and handle complex patient requests effectively.
- **Fitness Data Integration**: Standardizing Fitbit data to provide clear, actionable health insights.

Despite these challenges, we successfully developed a platform that bridges the gap between AI, blockchain, and healthcare—empowering users with secure and intelligent medical assistance.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

- Successfully integrating blockchain to securely store medical data.
- Writing and deploying Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure and transparent healthcare interactions, using Truffle for contract development and testing.

- Creating a user-friendly web interface for patients and doctors.

## What We Learned

Throughout the development of Med-AI, we gained valuable insights into several areas:

- **Blockchain & IPFS**: How decentralized storage can improve the security and accessibility of medical records.
- **Smart Contracts**: Writing Solidity smart contracts to handle secure interactions and deploying them on the Ethereum blockchain with Ganache for testing, using Truffle for smoother development.
- **Medical AI Models**: Implementing **MedLLaMA-2** to provide reliable medical assistance and answering patient queries effectively.
- **Conversational AI**: Using **RASA AI** to build an intelligent chatbot for appointment scheduling, medication reminders, and medicine ordering.
- **Data Integration**: Successfully syncing Fitbit data to offer personalized healthcare insights.
- **Scalability Challenges**: Understanding how to efficiently scale a decentralized healthcare solution.

## What's Next for Med-AI

Moving forward, we plan to:

- **Enhance AI diagnostics** by improving MedLLaMA-2’s capabilities.
- **Expand healthcare provider integrations** for real-time collaboration.
- **Develop a mobile application** for easier access to Med-AI services.
- **Introduce predictive health analytics** to provide early warnings based on fitness data trends.
- **Improve system scalability** to accommodate a larger user base efficiently.
- **Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER)** on medical reports to provide users with actionable insights and assistance.

Med-AI is a step towards a decentralized, AI-powered healthcare ecosystem. By combining blockchain for security, AI for intelligence, and fitness integrations for proactive care, we aim to revolutionize the way healthcare is managed. We are excited about the potential future enhancements and expanding our platform’s impact.
